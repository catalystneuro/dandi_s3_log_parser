# Raw S3 Log parser

Simple reductions of consolidated S3 logs (consolidation step not included in this repository) into minimal information for sharing and plotting.

Developed for the DANDI Archive.



# Developer notes

`.log` file suffixes should typically be ignored when working with Git, so when committing changes to the example log collection, you will have to forcibly include it with

```bash
git add -f <example file name>.log
```
